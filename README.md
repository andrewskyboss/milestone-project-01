### Design Choices

This project was built based on UX concerns: website should be useful, usable and valuable for the customer and owner. As well to get a positive user experience, were used process of five planes of user experience:
- **Strategy Plane**  – represents business goals. The main website owner goals were presented above. Just a reminder, that main user of this website will be a business people. Whole design should be kept simple in classical style with some bright elements (in this project Imperial Red color plays as bright element). Design should be plain and modern. Information should be well structured and easy to access. Main parts of the information are placed into top navigation. No more than 3 clicks to get information about website owner. Download button is placed in a footer navigation to get CV printable copy.

- **Scope plane** - represents features we want to include into design. This project features are: 
  - Header and footer navigation.
  - Intuitive design.
  - Short description on top of the page.
  - Contact form with CTA, to be in touch with website's owner.
  - Social media icons
  - Biography (Study and work history)

  - Embedded portfolios.

- **Structure plane** - Usually users are visiting website to get just for some king of content. Information is logically structured into main parts. All parts placed to the navigation.

- **Skeleton plane** - part for mock-ups:
  - Wireframes links are presented below:
  - [Link to a Wireframes for a Desctop view](assets/documents/A.Cybovskij-Desctop.pdf)
  - [Link to a Wireframes for Tablet and Mobile views ](assets/documents/A.Cybovskij-Tablet-mobile.pdf)

- **Surface plane** - final part of design procedure. The project build in a Classical style. Cinzel and Rylaway fonts gives easy shapes. Shades of Blue, Red and gold are acceptable by the business people as a pleasant and trust. Images are very clear and simple. First look to the website gives a feeling about website owner. Elegant fade in animation gives lightweight and elegance feeling.

#### Colors
The main inspiration of the colors started from the Oxford Blue color.

By the [empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com website](https://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/blue-in-business.html#:~:text=Blue%20is%20the%20most%20universally,indicates%20confidence%2C%20reliability%20and%20responsibility.) 
"Blue is the most universally favored color of all and therefore the safest to use. It relates to trust, honesty and dependability, therefore helping to build customer loyalty. Blue indicates confidence, reliability and responsibility"
- As a major color, the Oxford Blue (#0A0E29) is responsible to create a trust feeling from an employer to a potential employee. 
- Space Cadet (#2D325A) is a same blue group color and gives a variety and lighter shade. 
- Secondary color is Imperial Red (#F71735). As a shade of red, gives us feeling of energy, passion and action. It’s important to show a creativity and energy for a potential employer. 
- Accent color is Gold Metallic (#DBB13B). As a shade of yellow should create a feeling of success, achievement and triumph. 
- Pale Purple Pantone (#F1E4F3) color is a neutral and combines all colors together
- Combination of those colors should create emotional trust and future potential. Those feelings and website content should help the Author to achieve his goals to be hired.
